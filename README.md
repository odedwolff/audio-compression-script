A script for converting a folder tree with arbitrary structure containing audio files 
to a similarly structured tree in which corresponding files are compressed.
motivation behind this is achieving susbstential reduction in library size while compromising

audio becomes just recognizable enough to be useful, but use the bit rate parameter to set 
trade off between size reduction and loss of quality. 

the script was developed and tested on a window platform.
